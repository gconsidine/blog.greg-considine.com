I'm evaluating Ghost because my own CMS / e-commerce platform ambitions are being
shelved for the time being.  Maybe it'll be the subject of my first blog when the time
comes, but ultimately, it's just too large of an undertaking and involves too many wanderings 
down well-trodden paths to make the time investment worthwhile.

The projects I reference are here if you're interested: [plz-cms](https://github.com/gconsidine/plz-cms) and [cockpit](https://github.com/gconsidine/cockpit).  The goal was to create decoupled 
client-side and server-side projects that played nicely together.  And on the server, I was going 
for more of a library approach rather than a platform approach, which would have given a user 
the ability to use it within the context of any Node.js framework.
